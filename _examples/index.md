These examples demonstrate the features that Hyper3D provides, and show how to use them.

WebGL-enabled web browser ([Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is recommended) is required to see these examples. Furthermore, a high-end video card might be required for them to run at an acceptable frame rate, though they can run on a wide range of video cards.

You can browse the source code at the [GitHub source code page](https://github.com/Hyper3D/hyper3d-examples/tree/master/_examples). See [Get Started](/start) to start using Hyper3D.

**Hyper3D is still at a very ealy stage of development.** You might observe an unexpected behavior including distorted image, browser crash, peformance breakdown, and shader compilation failure.
